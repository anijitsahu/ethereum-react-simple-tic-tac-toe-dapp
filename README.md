# truffle-react-simple-tic-tac-toe-dapp
A Simple Distributed Tic Tac Toe Application using [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), a JavaScript library to make awesome UI by Facebook, [Ethereum Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), a framework for Ethereum blockchain development, and [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/), official language to write Smart Contracts in Ethereum.

This application uses [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) component oriented UI creation paradigm. All components are written in [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and ES6 style and are
combined to get a single build for production purpose using [Purcel](https://parceljs.org/). This application uses *Custom Hook* design feature introduced in [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) v16.8. 

ES6 `module` creation along with `import /export`, `async/ await` is used. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react) is used to *transpile* all [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) code to vanilla JavaScript code. To install all the dependecies `npm` is used.

Back end is implemented using [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/). Communication with the Smart Contracts is done using [Web3 JS](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.6/)


For UI creation [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) and [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) are used. [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), the new feature of [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) is used for layout creation purpose.

This is a *responsive web application* for viewing in both Mobile and Desktop.
